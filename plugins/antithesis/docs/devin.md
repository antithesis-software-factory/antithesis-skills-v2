# Before starting

* Ensure Devin is added to the repository (Settings → Environment).

# Customer setup

* Add organization secrets (Settings → Secrets)
  * ANTITHESIS_API_KEY
  * ANTITHESIS_TENANT
  * ANTITHESIS_REPOSITORY (GAR repository url)
  * ANTITHESIS_GAR_KEY
* Install the plugin (Customize → Plugins).
  * Choose to either install it on the enterprise, organization, or personal scope
* Create an automation with a webhook trigger (Automations → New automation → Webhook), with this prompt. Save the webhook URL and secret; the secret is shown only once.

   ```
   An Antithesis run has started. The webhook payload has this format:

   {
   "event": "run_start",
   "run_id": "<Antithesis run ID>",
   "title": "<run title>"
   }

   Triage the run with `/antithesis triage` from the Antithesis plugin. The code under test is @<owner>/<repo>. Report issues to that github repository.
   ```

   `@<owner>/<repo>` must be an `@` mention: it is what gives the session the repository.

* Launch Antithesis runs with the webhook as the run-start callback:

   ```bash
   snouty launch --webhook advanced_test ... \
     --param custom.callback.run_start.url=$DEVIN_WEBHOOK_URL \
     --param custom.callback.run_start.token=$DEVIN_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   ```

   Antithesis calls the webhook once the deployment has settled and faults are about to start. The token is stored with the run's launch parameters, so anyone who can see the run can see it.
