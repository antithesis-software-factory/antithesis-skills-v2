# Monitor a running run

Follow the run with `snouty runs stream` in the background, as "Read the properties" describes, so you can triage while it runs.

1. Tell the user about each property as it fails.
2. Triage each failing property in its own subagent, following "Investigate a failing property". The run is live, so you can also run commands at a failing moment: see `references/debug/MODULE.md`.
3. Report each failure as its triage finishes. See "Report".

When the stream prints `completed`, continue with `references/triage/summary.md`.
