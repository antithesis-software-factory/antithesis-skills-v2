# The driver

The driver is a hegel concurrent state machine run from `#[hegel::main]`. Each `#[rule]` is one action: it draws its inputs, sends a request, and records the outcome in the model. Hegel runs the rules on several worker threads, in rounds. The next round starts only when every worker is done, so one slow rule stalls them all.

## Example

This drives a replicated key-value store with no client library, with `PUT /k/<key>` and `GET /k/<key>` on any node, that promises linearizable reads.

Depend on `hegeltest` with `features = ["static-engine"]`, and on `antithesis_sdk`. Left out below: the HTTP client (`put`, `get`), reading the node list from `KV_URLS`, `draw_target` (a node and one of `KEYS` keys), and `KeyHistory`'s `sent`, `acked` and `overlaps` (a write was in flight during the read). `acked` finds its write by value, since pruning may have moved it.

```rust
/// Short, so a request to an unreachable node costs a moment, not a stalled round.
const TIMEOUT: Duration = Duration::from_millis(1000);
/// How long a write with an unknown outcome stays possible. Systems apply such writes
/// soon or never, and keeping them forever would let the check accept almost anything.
const AMBIGUITY_WINDOW: Duration = Duration::from_secs(60);

/// One write to a key. `acked` is when the system acknowledged it, or `None` if we never
/// learned the outcome, in which case it may still take effect.
struct Write { value: u32, sent: Instant, acked: Option<Instant> }

/// Every write sent to one key.
#[derive(Default)]
struct KeyHistory { writes: Vec<Write> }

impl KeyHistory {
    /// A write is overwritten before time `t` if another write was sent after it was
    /// acknowledged, and was itself acknowledged before `t`.
    fn overwritten_before(&self, w: &Write, t: Instant) -> bool {
        let Some(w_acked) = w.acked else { return false }; // it could still land later
        self.writes.iter().any(|o| o.sent > w_acked && o.acked.is_some_and(|a| a < t))
    }

    /// Forgets writes no read can return any more, so checks stay cheap in long runs: writes
    /// overwritten more than two timeouts ago (no read still in flight started before that),
    /// and unacknowledged writes older than `AMBIGUITY_WINDOW`.
    fn prune(&mut self) {
        let now = Instant::now();
        let Some(horizon) = now.checked_sub(2 * TIMEOUT) else { return };
        let keep: Vec<bool> = self.writes.iter().map(|w| match w.acked {
            None => now.duration_since(w.sent) < AMBIGUITY_WINDOW,
            Some(_) => !self.overwritten_before(w, horizon),
        }).collect();
        let mut keep = keep.into_iter();
        self.writes.retain(|_| keep.next().unwrap());
    }
}

```

## Rules

- **Run forever.** Call `.steps(i64::MAX)`; the default stops after 50 rounds and the binary exits. Don't use `tc.repeat`.
- **Use Antithesis SDK assertions, never panics.** Put the values you'd need to debug in the details.
- **Generate only.** Keep `phases = [hegel::Phase::Generate]` on `#[hegel::main]`.
- **Cover the surface you mapped.** Draw options; don't hard-code the common case.
- **Let requests contend.** Don't serialize requests per key to keep the model simple. Record when each request was sent and when its outcome arrived, so a property can allow every outcome consistent with what overlapped it. If the system orders operations itself (log positions, sequence numbers), record that order too.
- **Record unknown outcomes as unknown.** A request that timed out or lost its connection may or may not have taken effect, now or later.

## Driving client containers

With client containers (`references/workload/clients.md`), the rules above still hold, with the driver sending commands to a client program instead of requests to the servers. A few things change:

- **Each rule draws which client acts.** Bugs between clients need several of them acting on the same keys, locks or transactions.
- **Outcomes arrive as events.** Tag each operation with an ID and wait for the response only up to the usual short timeout. A background thread receives the client programs' completion events on their own UDP port, separate from the logs, and resolves each operation in the model as its event arrives, the way `references/workload/system-logs.md` handles log lines as they arrive. An operation without an event stays unknown until its client's boot changes or the ambiguity window passes. A dropped event leaves its operation unknown, which is safe.
- **Bursts are cheap.** Since outcomes arrive as events, a rule can send several operations to one client without waiting for their responses. That gets the library batching beyond what the worker count allows.
- **A changed boot identifier means the client restarted.** Everything outstanding on its old boot gets an unknown outcome, and the model forgets that client's sessions, locks and open transactions. Unknown includes what the client believed: a client that was paused, not restarted, may still think it holds a lock that has since expired.
- **An unreachable client is normal.** It may be paused or mid-restart. Treat commands to it as unknown, and keep driving the other clients.
- **Read-only checks may go to the servers directly**, as described in `references/workload/clients.md`. Actions never do.

**Keep rules relatively fast:**
- Use short timeouts. Give operations that are slow by design their own.
- Don't sleep or poll. Record what you expect, and check it in a later rule. The one exception is a quiet period (below), which waits for recovery on purpose.
- Keep long-lived interactions (streams, sessions, transactions) in the driver's state, across rules.
- Run blocking operations (watches, long-polls, blocking pops) on a background thread, record the result in the driver's state, and check it in a later rule. Bounded retries that mirror a real client's are fine inside a rule.

**Weight actions toward what's hard to reach**, so options and rare interactions happen many times in every timeline.

**Use `#[invariant(always_run)]`, not plain `#[invariant]`.** With `.steps(i64::MAX)`, a plain invariant effectively never runs. An `always_run` invariant runs after every round, while no rules run, and every round waits for it.

## Guiding exploration

The assertions the workload writes aren't properties. A property says what the system must do, and its failure is a bug; properties come from the properties module. The workload's assertions mark states worth reaching. Their failure means the workload never reached that state.

They matter for two reasons:

- **They show what the workload reaches.** Coverage shows which code ran. These show which situations happened: a read overlapping a write to the same key, a leader change while a follower lags.
- **Antithesis explores from them.** They mark interesting states for Antithesis.

The assertions:

- **`assert_sometimes!`**: a situation that should happen at least once per run. Examples:
    - A leader election is triggered
    - A transaction aborts
    - A rate limiter rejects a request
    - A search returns no results
    - A cache entry expires and is refilled
    - A read returns a value written by another client
    - A compaction runs while reads are in flight
    - Two clients edit the same document at the same time

  If both a situation and its opposite are possible (a game is sometimes won and sometimes lost), add one for each.

- **`assert_reachable!`**: code that should run at least once. The same as `assert_sometimes!(true, ...)`.
- **Numeric and boolean forms** (`assert_sometimes_greater_than!`, `assert_sometimes_all!`, and so on): a situation that's a comparison or a combination, like a follower falling more than 10 entries behind. They tell Antithesis how close each moment came, which guides its search better than true or false.

Where to put them:

- **On the rare outcome of every action** in the surface you mapped, and on both sides of every option.
- **On situations that need faults**, so a run shows whether faults reached them.
- **On combinations no single request shows**, from the model or the nodes' state in the logs (`references/workload/system-logs.md`).

Each message is one assertion in Antithesis, and assertions that share a message merge into it. Keep messages fixed and put changing values in the details.

## Choosing how often things happen

- **Groups control overlap, not frequency.** Each round hegel picks one group, and every worker runs only its rules. Use separate groups only for rules that must never overlap. Groups can't be weighted.
- **Weights are a hint** for the mix within a group, not a guarantee.
- **Explicit draws set exact probabilities.** Use `tc.draw(gs::weighted_booleans(p))`, or a phase in the driver's state, when a rate matters.

Put a rare action in the main group behind a rare draw, not in its own group, which would get as many rounds as any other. If it must not overlap other operations, run it from the `always_run` invariant behind a rare draw, as the quiet period does.

## Quiet periods

A quiet period pauses faults so the system can recover. Properties that hold only once faults stop, like every node serving again or acknowledged writes being readable, are checked there. Run the whole quiet period inside one call of an `#[invariant(always_run)]`. No rule runs until it returns, so the checks see a quiet system, and it can wait for recovery there. A per-round `weighted_booleans` draw starts quiet periods at a rate you choose. Pause faults with `ANTITHESIS_STOP_FAULTS <seconds>` for longer than the whole check takes; faults resume on their own afterwards. For the example above:

```rust
/// Chance per round of starting a quiet period. Measure rounds per second locally,
/// then pick this for roughly one quiet period every few minutes of a timeline.
const P_QUIET: f64 = 1.0 / 3000.0;
const QUIET: Duration = Duration::from_secs(60);    // how long faults stay paused
const DEADLINE: Duration = Duration::from_secs(45); // every node must serve by then

#[invariant(always_run)]
fn quiet_period(&self, tc: TestCase) {
    if !tc.draw(gs::weighted_booleans(P_QUIET)) {
        return;
    }
    if let Some(bin) = std::env::var_os("ANTITHESIS_STOP_FAULTS") {
        let _ = std::process::Command::new(bin).arg(QUIET.as_secs().to_string()).status();
    }
    // Restarted containers take a while to come back. Retry each node until it serves,
    // or until DEADLINE. With client containers, wait for them too.
    let healthy: Vec<bool> = self.wait_for_nodes(DEADLINE);
    assert_sometimes!(!healthy.contains(&false), "the system recovered after faults stopped", &json!({"healthy": healthy}));
}
```

Clock faults continue during a pause, so allow for clock jumps. To test a quiet period locally, set the probability to 1.
